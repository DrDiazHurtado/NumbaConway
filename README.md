"Simple rules. Infinite complexity. A tribute to life, Conway, and the beauty of emergence."


This simple code is a **tribute to John Horton Conway's Game of Life**, one of the most iconic examples of cellular automata. Conceived in 1970, the Game of Life demonstrates how simple rules can give rise to complex and emergent behaviors, bridging the gap between mathematics, computer science, and biology.

The project encapsulates several philosophical ideas:
- **Emergence from simplicity:** Simulation is governed by just a few rules, yet it results in highly intricate patterns.
- **Interconnectedness:** The toroidal grid illustrates a world where boundaries are continuous, much like nature's lack of hard edges.
- **Mortality and renewal:** Cells live, age, die, and are reborn, mirroring the cycles of life in the natural world.
