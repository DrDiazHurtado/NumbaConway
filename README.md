## A tribute to life and the beauty of emergence.


This very simple code is a **tribute to John Horton Conway's Game of Life**, one of the most iconic examples of cellular automata. Conceived in 1970, the Game of Life demonstrates how simple rules can give rise to complex and emergent behaviors. 

The project encapsulates several ideas:
- **Emergence from simplicity:** Simulation is governed by just a few rules.
- **Mortality and renewal:** Cells live, age, die, and are reborn, mirroring the cycles of life in the natural world.
